    processes that make buildds hang forever. With this, I expect that we
    don't need to set timeouts for the test suite at all (Closes: #674942).
  * Added patch by Steven Chamberlain to make ruby1.8-dev depend on gcc-4.6,
    since Ruby will hard code that as the compiler for building C extensions.
    Any C extension will FTBFS if gcc-4.6 is not installed (Closes: #675347).
